## A Love-Song Lyric Generator

## Problem Statement
This project aims to build a love-song lyric generator using NLP and neural network methods. Songs to train the model will be selected from popular Spotify-curated playlists and the lyrics will be queried from the Genius database. Pre-trained word vectors used in the initial NLP analysis to provide a foundation for sentiment and LSA training. Additionally, document structure will be learned during NLP processing. The trained word and document vectors will then be used to build a LSTM or CNN that can generate new lyrics built from user-generated initial seed terms.

This has direct application for building interactive AI/ML tools that generate more humanistic text. Possible implementations include chatbots, therapy / emotional support tools, enterprise document generators, and other language-based products and services.
